           <p class="desc">Welcome, it's so nice to have you here.</p>
           <p class="desc">My passion for photography began long ago, when i had no camera yet, but everytime my sister were visiting us, i was "borrowing" her camera and started shooting anything that came my way.
               So in time I grew up and I worked enough to afford my own camera :) </p>
           <p class="desc">I enjoy the small, simple things. I put all the love and passion in my art. Photography is my way of showing others the importance of take in the beauty around them and to celebrate life. I love giving people the gift of art as way to remember the special times in life; graduating from high school, having a new baby, engagement, and family bonds.</p>
           <p class="desc">There are many mysterious and wild places on this earth we are not aware of. They may be right in front of us, one has to run wild and free to feel it. I try to capture it.</p>
           <p class="desc">
I also love coffe, i love spending time with my beloved husband, i love listening music and i do love to sing...loud :D</p>
